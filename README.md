# Yet Another DDD Library
## Value object

This library is a foundation in order to implement the [Value Object pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html).

It helps you to introduce some DDD stuff in your projects without much effort but still in the right way. 
It provide yoi some basic and ready to use "primitives" and a simple serializer. 
It doesn't cover all the possibile use cases, then use it if you want, or contribute if you like what we are doing and want to expand it.

## Usage
> Requires PHP 8

    composer require yaddls/value-object:^0.5
> NOT YET IN PACKAGIST, COMING SOON!
